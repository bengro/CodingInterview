**My Java solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview.**

## Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings
1. Strings are converted to arrays using toCharrArray() method provided by the String class.
2. When the number of unique elements is small, sorting can be in O(n) (à la bucket sort).
3. Always ask what data the array contains to find out about possible optimizations.
4. StringBuffer brings down String concatenation to amortized O(n) - instead of O(n^2).
5. Definition "String rotation": string of same size and identical letter sequence but with arbitrary offset.

## Chapter 2: Linked Lists
1. Comparisons with == operator or isEqual: == checks whether two variable point to the same reference. isEqual compares the objects values.
